# Credit Risk Prediction Project

# Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning system that predicts whether a customer will default on a loan.

The dataset contains customer, loan, lender, and economic indicator information from Kenya. The goal is to use this information to develop a predictive model capable of identifying high-risk borrowers.

Some customers may appear multiple times in the dataset, and a single loan may also appear with different lenders. This means that some loans are funded by multiple lenders.

Additional macroeconomic indicators from the FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) portal are also provided to enrich the dataset.

# Problem Statement

Financial institutions face significant losses when customers fail to repay loans. Traditional credit scoring methods may not fully capture customer behaviour and economic conditions.

The challenge is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict loan default risk using historical loan, customer, and economic data.

---

# Objectives

The project objectives are to:

* Understand the structure of the dataset
* Explore relationships between features and loan default behaviour
* Clean and preprocess the data
* Engineer useful features
* Build and evaluate machine learning classification models
* Compare model performance
* Save the best-performing model
* Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI

# Type of Machine Learning Problem

This is a:

## Supervised Machine Learning Problem

More specifically:

## Binary Classification

| Target Value | Meaning                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 0            | Customer repaid the loan       |
| 1            | Customer defaulted on the loan |

The target distribution is highly imbalanced: most customers repay their loans, while defaults are rare. Because of this, accuracy alone is not a reliable evaluation metric. The model should be evaluated using metrics that measure how well it identifies the default class.

# 8. Model Training

This project is a binary classification problem with mixed numerical, categorical, ID-like, and date-based features. The most relevant classification methods are:

## Recommended Classifiers

* **Logistic Regression**
  * Strong baseline model for binary credit risk prediction
  * Easy to interpret
  * Works well with encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features

* **Decision Tree Classifier**
  * Useful for understanding nonlinear decision rules
  * Easy to visualize and explain
  * Can overfit if not controlled with pruning or depth limits

* **Random Forest Classifier**
  * Stronger and more stable than a single decision tree
  * Handles nonlinear relationships well
  * Useful for feature importance analysis

* **Gradient Boosting Models**
  * Examples: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
  * Usually strong performers for tabular credit-risk data
  * CatBoost is especially useful when working with categorical features

* **Voting Classifier**
  * Can combine multiple models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
  * Useful after individual models have been trained and compared

## Optional Classifiers

* **Support Vector Machines**
  * Can be tested, especially linear SVM variants
  * May be slower and harder to tune on larger tabular datasets

* **Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier**
  * Fast linear classifier
  * Useful for scalable baseline experiments

## Less Relevant for This Project

* **Nearest Neighbors**
  * Sensitive to feature scaling and high-dimensional encoded categorical variables
  * Usually not the best fit for this type of credit-risk dataset

* **Gaussian Processes**
  * Computationally expensive for this dataset size
  * Not practical as a main model

* **Multiclass and Multioutput Algorithms**
  * Not needed because the target has only two classes: `0` and `1`

Possible evaluation metrics:

* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* ROC-AUC
* PR-AUC
* Confusion Matrix

Accuracy can still be reported, but it should not be the main metric because the default class is rare. For this project, recall and precision for the default class are especially important.
